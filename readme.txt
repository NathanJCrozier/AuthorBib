The folder authorbib contains all of the source files for all of the classes needed to run my program.
The folder bibFiles contains all of the files I used and created when running my program.
The folder doc contains all of the javadoc created for this program.

If you wish to run the program on another computer, please place the bibFile folder into your project folder, and search for the String constant at the top of the AuthorBibCreator class and change that to match your computer's directory. You can replace the Latex files in the bibFile folder with whatever you wish. Provided they are still labelled Latex[1-10].bib it should still run as expected.
